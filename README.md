_a method, a tender affection_
jacopo greco d'alceo

In today's realm of composition, the role of a composer extends far beyond traditional score writing, demanding an exploration of technology and innovative approaches to musical creation. Cordelia emerges as a response to this challenge, a project that bridges the gap between composition boundaries and personal methodology. Originally conceived as a live coding language, Cordelia has evolved into a versatile tool that navigates the intersection of algorithmic improvisation and traditional musical notation. Through this fusion, Cordelia seeks to expand our understanding of contemporary music by embracing technology as a catalyst for creativity.

The project exemplifies this concept through the concrete realization of *chiedimi le mie radici*. This musical and choreographic performance embodies the essence of Cordelia, aiming to dissolve the boundaries between musical thought and gesture. The piece explores an intimate relationship between the performer, space, and sound, immersing the audience in a sensorial experience that transcends conventional expression.

Beyond its role as a live coding language, Cordelia represents a methodological shift in composition, integrating seamlessly with audio editing and notation software. By mastering Cordelia's fundamental parameters – timbre, duration, dynamics, morphology, and frequency – composers gain a nuanced understanding of musical manipulation, transcending mere technique to shape the very structure of artistic practice.

Central to Cordelia's ethos is the ethos of documentation and knowledge sharing. As the project evolves, comprehensive documentation will be compiled to disseminate Cordelia's ideas, techniques, and possibilities within the composer and artist community. Inspired by the principles of open-source sharing, Cordelia aims to foster a culture of collaboration and innovation in contemporary composition.

In essence, Cordelia embodies the spirit of rebellion against conventional expression, striving to uncover the truth in music beyond linguistic constraints. Through its development and dissemination, Cordelia represents a beacon of authenticity and creativity, enriching the landscape of contemporary composition for generations to come.
